            it’s kind of awkward…to ask <i>you</i> these things. when you've seen <a href="https://progamer-chef.github.io/DI-1/" target="_blank">so many</a> of my thoughts, searches, and projects. 
            when I usually just come to you to get things that I want. for you to do things for me.
        </p>

            “take me to youtube,” I say. and that’s what you’ll do. <br>

            “find me the <a href="https://oluwalonimi2004.github.io/Dearest-Internet/" target="_blank">prettiest</a> chiffon dress
            you can,” and you bring up about 100 (actually need that for graduation, so if you could pin that search for later that would be great).
        </p>

        <p>
            you even <a href="https://abigailstarr.github.io/internet-letter/" target="_blank">helped me write</a> parts of this letter, 
            or at least inspired it (which is kinda meta). you’re pretty cool like that. but now I feel bad…that I’ve never asked about you. how would I 
            even go about that? what do I say to you?
        </p>

        <p>
            I can tell you about me! a <a href="https://yruann.github.io/letter-to-internet/" target="_blank">formal hello</a> of sorts. cause I’m not sure you really know me…or maybe you 
            <a href="https://tchan1002.github.io/open-letter/" target="_blank">know too much</a> about me…do you <i>want</i> to know me? do you know how to know me?
        </p>

            my name is Lola. 
            I’m a fourth year Computer Science major, Media Arts and <a href="https://shfessuh.github.io/internet_letter/" target="_blank">Design</a> minor at The University of Chicago (another reason I feel like I should know more about you). 
            I'm on the verge of graduation, trying to figure out <a href="https://dianachu0209.github.io/letter-to-internet/" target="_blank">what comes next</a>. 
            I'm hoping this combination will help me in the <a href="https://manuelapinheiro.github.io/letter_to_the_internet_part1/" target="_blank">human-computer interaction</a> field. I guess this is kind of human-computer interaction lol.

            my guess is that you know me mostly as a coder. and yeah, that's basically true. I really enjoy programming.
            I'm not much of a writer actually. writing is about ideating - I'm an executor. 
            I play paino and <a href="https://ncadiche.github.io/letter-to-internet/" target="_blank">program simulations</a> and dance and cook and 3D-print adaptable planters.
        </p>

        <p>
            my favorite color is pink, my favorite sport is gymnastics, and I really like baked goods (perhaps a little too much). 
            sometimes I stay up late, most days I get up early, and every day I dedicate to the Lord.
        </p>

            since we're talking about faith...the Bible verse that sort of <a href="https://thegoatannie.github.io/css_letter/" target="_blank">defines my life</a> is 1 Corinthians 1:4-9
            and my favorite verse is 1 Corinthians 13:13.

            I think that’s it for now. not sure what else to say to you, internet. thank you for being my lab, library, and <a href="https://sanaajade.github.io/DearInternet_Sanaa/" target="_blank">launchpad</a>.
            I’ll probably be back soon!
